## Structure & Conventions

### Project Artifacts & Layout

- Test scripts go in the `test_scripts` folder; create the folder if it doesn't exist.
- Plans live under `docs/design/`, one file per plan, named `plan-NNN-<indicative-description>.md`.
- The complete project design is maintained in `docs/design/project-design.md`; update it with each new design or design change.
- All reference material used for the project is collected and kept under `docs/reference/`.
- All functional requirements and feature descriptions are registered in `docs/design/project-functions.md`.
- Every prompt created while working in a project goes in a dedicated `prompts` folder (create it if missing); each prompt file name has a sequential number prefix and is representative of the prompt's use and purpose.
- Maintain `Issues - Pending Items.md` at the project root: register every issue, pending item, inconsistency, or discrepancy you detect, and whenever you fix a defect or issue, check the file for an item to remove. Pending items come first (most critical and important on top), completed items after.
- Every time you are asked to solve an issue, you must resolve it AND thoroughly document both the issue and the solution.

<configuration-guide>
- If the user asks for a configuration guide, create it at `docs/design/configuration-guide.md` and make sure it explains:
  - When multiple configuration options exist (config file, env variables, CLI params, etc.), what the options are and the priority of each one.
  - The purpose and use of each configuration variable.
  - How the user can obtain such a configuration variable.
  - The recommended approach for storing or managing the variable.
  - Which options exist for the variable and what each option means for the project.
  - Any default value the parameter has.
  - For configuration parameters that expire (e.g., PAT keys, tokens), propose adding a parameter that captures the expiration date, so the app or service can proactively warn users to renew.
</configuration-guide>

### Tools

- Tools created in the context of a project are always written in TypeScript.
- **Tool creation is MANDATORY via `/tool-conventions scaffold <tool-name>`.** Do NOT scaffold a tool's documentation file or its `~/.tool-agents/<tool-name>/` configuration folder by hand under any circumstances. The slash command dispatches the `tool-doc-config-architect` subagent (`~/.claude/agents/tool-doc-config-architect.md`), which owns the full specification — the documentation file format (the `<toolName>` XML block under `docs/tools/<tool-name>.md`), the configuration folder structure and modes (`~/.tool-agents/<tool-name>/` at `0700`, `.env` at `0600`), the four-tier env-var resolution chain (shell env → `~/.tool-agents/<name>/.env` → local `.env` → CLI flags, lowest to highest priority), the vendor-canonical LLM provider env-var names (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_*`, `AZURE_AI_INFERENCE_*`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, `LITELLM_*`), and the required set of eight standard LLM providers every LLM-enabled tool must support out of the box. Read the subagent prompt to inspect the full specification. For existing tools, run `/tool-conventions audit <tool-name>` to verify conformance.
- The project's CLAUDE.md must NOT contain full tool documentation. It must contain a "Tools" section with a concise entry per tool: the tool's name, a one-or-two-sentence description of what it is capable of, and the relative path to its dedicated documentation file (e.g. `docs/tools/<tool-name>.md`) so the full documentation can be retrieved any time it is needed. The slash command produces the recommended entry text after each scaffold.
- Before writing any code script, examine the tools already implemented in the project (via the "Tools" section of the project's CLAUDE.md and the documentation under `docs/tools/`) to detect whether the planned code fits the scope of an existing tool. If so, implement it as an extension of that tool; otherwise build a generic, abstract version of the code as a new tool in the project's toolset. The goal is to progressively grow the tools needed to test, evaluate, generate data, collect information, etc., and reuse them consistently — all referenced in the project's CLAUDE.md.

### General Rules

- When asked to locate code, report the folder, the file name, the class, and the line number together with the code extract.
- Don't perform any version-control operation unless explicitly requested.
- Database table naming: table names must be singular (e.g. the table keeping customers' data is `Customer`). Tables expressing references from one entity to another may be plural when the first entity links to many of the second — so with `Customer` and `Transaction` tables, the link table is `CustomerTransactions`.
- NEVER create fallback solutions for configuration settings. Whenever a configuration setting is not provided, raise the appropriate exception — never substitute the missing value with a default or fallback. If the user explicitly asks for an exception to this rule, write the exception in the project's memory file before implementing it.

<dependency-vetting>
- Before adding ANY new runtime dependency to a project (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.), you MUST verify the version you are about to pin is free of known security advisories. Apply this rule especially to:
  - **Browser/embedded-engine packages:** `electron`, `puppeteer`, `playwright`, `chromium`, `webview2` — they ship with full browser engines and accumulate CVEs fast.
  - **Test/build toolchains:** `vitest`, `vite`, `esbuild`, `webpack`, `rollup`, `parcel` — frequent dev-server-RCE advisories with transitive impact.
  - **Network/proxy libraries:** `node-http-proxy`, `http-proxy-3`, `proxy-chain`, `axios`, `node-fetch`, `request`, `got`, `undici`.
  - **Cryptography / auth libraries:** `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`, `bcrypt`, `node-forge`, `crypto-js`.

- Vetting procedure (run BEFORE writing the dependency into the manifest):
  1. Identify the latest stable major version available on the registry (e.g. `npm view <pkg> versions --json | tail -10` or `pnpm info <pkg> versions --json`).
  2. Check the package's security advisory page (GitHub Advisory Database, npmjs.com vulnerability tab, or `npm audit --package <pkg>@<version> --json`) for the candidate version.
  3. If the candidate version has unfixed advisories at HIGH severity or above, bump to the next non-vulnerable major (or, if no such version exists, surface the trade-off to the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding).
  4. Pin to a caret range against the verified clean version (e.g. `"electron": "^39.8.5"`, not `"electron": "^38"`).
  5. Record the vetted-on date in a one-line comment in `Issues - Pending Items.md` under a "Dependency vetting log" section so future audits can date the decision.

- For ESPECIALLY fast-moving packages (`electron`, `vite`, `vitest`, `esbuild`), ALWAYS pull the latest stable major even when a reference implementation uses an older one. The reference's version is informational, not authoritative — verify it is still on a supported branch before adopting it verbatim.

- After installing, ALWAYS run the project's audit command (`pnpm audit`, `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `go list -m -u -json all | nancy sleuth`, etc.) and confirm the advisory count is zero before marking the scaffolding step complete. Treat any HIGH-or-above advisory as a blocker; surface it before continuing.

- When a transitive dependency carries an advisory that the direct dependency has not yet fixed (e.g. `vitest@1` pulling `vite@5` with a CVE), use the package manager's override mechanism (`pnpm.overrides`, `npm overrides`, `yarn resolutions`, `cargo [patch]`) to force the fixed transitive version, AND document the override in `Issues - Pending Items.md` with its expiry condition (i.e. "remove this override once direct-dep X reaches version Y").
